					<h2>His Business Career</h2>
					<ul>

								<h3>Zip2</h3>
								<p>
									In 1995, Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds from
									angel investors. They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto. The company
									developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with
									maps, directions, and yellow pages. Musk says that before the company became successful, he
									could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and
									showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother. According to Musk, "The
									website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the
									time." The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,
									and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch. Musk's
									attempts to become CEO, a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin, were thwarted by the
									board. Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999. Musk received $22
									million for his 7-percent share.

								<h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>
								<p>
									In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company. The
									startup was one of the first online banks to be federally insured, and, within its initial
									months, over 200,000 customers joined the service. The company's investors saw Musk as
									inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year. The
									following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to prevent unnecessary competition.
									Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, Confinity had its own money-transfer service,
									PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service. Within the merged company, Musk
									returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the
									company and caused Thiel to resign. Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a
									cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September
									2000.e 3] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in
									2001. In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the
									largest shareholder with 11.7%—received over $100 million.

								<h3>SpaceX</h3>
								<p>
									In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to
									place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself. In
									October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles
									(ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO
									Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of
									the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In
									February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another
									meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk
									instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets. With $100 million of
									his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in
									May 2002. As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief
									Engineer.

								<h3>Tesla</h3>
								<p>
									Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and
									Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men
									played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led
									the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the
									majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active
									role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in
									day-to-day business operations. Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the
									2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the
									company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard
									designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others. As of 2019,
									Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.

								<h3>SEC lawsuit</h3>
								<p>
									In September 2018, Musk was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a
									tweet claiming funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. The lawsuit
									claimed that discussions Musk held with foreign investors in July 2018 did not confirm key
									deal terms and thus characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors,
									and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies. Musk called the
									allegations unjustified and claimed he had never compromised his integrity. Two days later,
									Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result,
									Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years
									as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.

								<h3>SolarCity and Tesla Energy</h3>
								<p>
									Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins
									Lyndon and Peter Rive co-founded in 2006. By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider
									of solar power systems in the United States. In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity
									building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the
									largest solar plant in the United States. Construction on the factory started in 2014 and
									was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020 when
									Panasonic departed.

								<h3>Neuralink</h3>
								<p>
									In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human
									brain with AI. Neuralink's purpose is to create devices that are embedded in the human brain
									to facilitate the merging of the brain with machines. The devices will also reconcile with
									the latest improvements in artificial intelligence to stay updated. Such improvements could
									enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software more effectively.

								<h3>The Boring Company</h3>
								<p>
									In 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels. In early 2017, they began
									discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide,
									50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's
									offices as it required no permits. A tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was
									completed in early 2021. Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel
									system.

								<h3>Managerial style and treatment of employees</h3>
								<p>
									Musk's managerial style and treatment of his employees has been heavily criticized. One
									person who worked closely with Musk said he exhibits "a high level of degenerate behavior"
									such as paranoia and bullying. Another described him as exhibiting "total and complete
									pathological sociopathy". Business Insider reported that Tesla employees were told not to
									walk past Musk's desk because of his "wild firing rampages". The Wall Street Journal
									reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as "self-driving", he faced
									criticism from his engineers, some of whom resigned in response, with one stating that
									Musk's "reckless decision making... ha potentially put customer lives at risk". The 2021
									book Power Play contains multiple anecdotes of Musk berating employees.
